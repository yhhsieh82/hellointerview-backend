Development Approach for This Project:

1. Specification First
   - Always clarify requirements before coding

2. TDD for Core Domain Logic
   - Write failing tests first
   - Implement code to pass tests

3. Implementation Order
   Spec → Tests → Code

4. Exceptions
   - Prototypes may skip TDD
   - Infrastructure code may use integration-first approach
